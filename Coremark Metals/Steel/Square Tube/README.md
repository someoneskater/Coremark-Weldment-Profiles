Mid-range tubes for moderate load-bearing applications. Wall thicknesses from 14ga to 1/2".

### Heavy Duty (6" - 12")
Large square tubes for heavy structural applications. Wall thicknesses from 1/8" to 1/2".

## Material Properties

### Finish
- Mill finish (non-coated)
- Semi-smooth grey surface
- Optional oil coating available

### Manufacturing Process
- Cold-formed electric resistance welded (ERW)
- Seamless options available for certain sizes

## Technical Notes

1. **Structural vs. Mechanical**: 
   - Use A500 Grade B for structural/load-bearing applications
   - Use A513 for mechanical/non-structural applications

2. **Weight Calculations**:
   - Weights listed are nominal and may vary ±5%
   - Based on steel density of 0.2836 lb/in³

3. **Weld Seam**:
   - All ERW tubes have a longitudinal weld seam
   - Seam location is random unless specified
